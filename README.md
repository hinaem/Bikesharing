# Bikesharing

Overview:
Purpose of this analysis:

During the Summer Kate and I went on a trip to New York City, exploring all landmarks such as Central Park, Statue of Liberty and more. One amazing transportation we discovered was Citibike. We Biked almost everywhere, which was easy to interact with the City and the people of the City using Citibikes in their everyday lives. Now that I am back from our trip, I was wondering if we can start the same type of buisness here in our hometown Des Moines, Iowa. There is a potential Investor I know whom might be interested in providing a share in the bikesharing program. 

This is a great prospective but thinking realistically making a buisness work here is much different that New York City. I'm going to use the skills I've learned in Tableau to make visualization that can also be presented to the investor and for me to have a better understanding of how the buiness works. I've found a CSV file fom https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data, which I will use to create the visulaizations. 

Results: 

In my tableau Public I have created a story book with my seven visualizations.
In my first story point I have used the Number of Trip and Ausgust Peak Hours Visualizations and have found the below:
From the file founded on ride.citibikenyc.com, I've started extracting data and as we can see the The number of trips found in the file are 2,344,244 in the month of August. Also the top riding hours durig August in New York City is 5:00pm to 7:00pm. I can suggest the bike maintenance should be performed during 2:00am to 5:00am. 

In the second story point I have used the Checkout Times for Users and Checkout Times by Gender Visualization and found the below:
From this we can see that 145,752 users use the bike for 6 minuets. This is a highly important point because it is where have the most users in whcih we make the most profit. Below I've added the checkout times by Gender to see if there is a difference between female or male. I've also used filter to easily extract the data from the graph. 

In the third story point I have used the Trips by Gender and have found the below:
In this graph I have visualized the trips by gender on a weekday per hour. We can use this to get into detail of which gender uses the service at which time. 

In the fourth story point I have used the Trips by Gender by Weekday and have found the below:
The CitiBike Transport can be used as a customer or a subscriber. A subscriber means that they have subscribed the service and uses it in their everyday lives; where a customer is someone using the service very minimally. We can see that theres a large count in each area but we can say that subscribers use the service much more than just customers. 

In the last story point I have used the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour and have found the below: 
I've used the below graph to visulaize the most busy times for the service as we can see during the week the most busy times are between 7:30am to 9:00am and 4:30pm to 7:00pm. During the weekend the most busy times is Saturday at 12pm. People also use it on Sunday but not as busy then the ones I've mentioned. 

Summary:

To conclude, I have used the data from New York City and have done all the visualizations to have a better understanding of how the service works. I would still say this is not enough to know if this should work for Iowa. I would need to find data to create visualizations on the commute for people in Iowa to see if this would work. Two visualizations I would create is one to see the distances people work.
